# Group-Assignment
This is the final group assignment for the semester. For this assignment you are required to use two design patterns that were covered post midterm.

They can be used in two separate problems, on using each, or in the same problem that require both.

Please select a problem/problems that are managable with regards to successful implementation.
When submitting your repository, please edit this readMe file to clearly describe the applications you have designed and mention what patterns you have chosen to you for them.
